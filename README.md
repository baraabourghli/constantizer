# Constantizer

Constantizer helps you manage your ruby constants to be used through out your application.

### Features

- Constants are added using YAML files.
- Constants files support ERB.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'constantizer'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

And then execute:

    $ bundle exec constantizer install

Constants directory will be created: 

    └── config
        └── constants
            └── common.yml

## Configurations

You can configure the gem to use a specific directory other than the default. To achive that, in constantizer.rb file add the following:

```ruby
Constantizer.configure do |config|
  config.directory = 'special_directory'
end
```  
now put the YAML files contaning the constants under that `special_directory`

## Usage

Constantizer allow you to create constants that are accessible from everywhere in your app.

Given the following YAML file

```yml
CURRENCIES:
  - USD
  - EUR
DEFAULT_CURRENCY: <%= CURRENCIES.first %>
```

you can go to anywhere in your app and do the following:

```ruby
CURRENCIES.include?('USD')
```
